## ⚡ Core Philosophy: Protocol over Prompting

Most AI coding assistants are "fire and forget"—they generate code, but they don't know *why* they wrote it, nor do they remember it later.

**Smart Playwright Agent** is not just a bot; it is a **Protocol** that enforces:

1. **Grounded Verification (via MCP):** The Agent must "touch" (highlight) an element via the Model Context Protocol before it is allowed to write a selector.
2. **Institutional Memory (`.ai/`):** A file-system based brain that stores architectural decisions, failure patterns, and verified selectors.
3. **Strict Governance:** The Agent acts as a "Senior Architect," adhering to strict Git standards, Page Object Models, and a 7-phase daily workflow.

## 🏗️ The Agent "Brain" Structure (`.ai/`)

Unlike other frameworks where context is lost when the chat window closes, this framework maintains a persistent memory on disk.

### `.ai/` - The Agent Brain

- **1_CONTEXT/** (Immutable Truths)
  - [mission.md](.ai/1_CONTEXT/mission.md) - The Agent's Prime Directives
  - [decision_log.md](.ai/1_CONTEXT/decision_log.md) - Architectural Decision Records (ADR)
  - [tech_stack.md](.ai/1_CONTEXT/tech_stack.md) - Approved tools & versions
- **2_PLANNING/** (Working Memory)
  - [active_sprint.md](.ai/2_PLANNING/active_sprint.md) - Current context & todo list
  - **maps/** - Visual UI maps (Screenshots)
  - **daily_logs/** - Session rollover history
- **3_MEMORY/** (Long-Term Memory)
  - [selector_vault.md](.ai/3_MEMORY/selector_vault.md) - Database of verified, working selectors
  - [failure_patterns.md](.ai/3_MEMORY/failure_patterns.md) - Library of known bugs & fixes
  - [lessons_learned.md](.ai/3_MEMORY/lessons_learned.md) - Strategic insights

## 🔌 Powered by MCP (Model Context Protocol)

This framework leverages the **`@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server`** to give the AI direct, tools-based access to the browser.

Instead of hallucinating selectors, the Agent executes tools:

- `mcp_highlight_element`: To visually confirm a selector works.
- `mcp_get_page_content`: To read the DOM structure intelligently.
- `mcp_screenshot`: To capture visual evidence for mapping.

## 🔄 The 7-Phase Daily Workflow

We treat AI interaction as a disciplined software development lifecycle, not a chat. (See [Full Workflow](.ai/1_CONTEXT/workflow.md))

### 🌅 **Phase 1: Morning Ritual (Session Startup)**

**"Context Loading."** The Agent reads the [`active_sprint.md`](.ai/2_PLANNING/active_sprint.md) and checks environment health before accepting tasks.

### 🟢 **Phase 2: Cartographer Mode (Discovery)**

**"Map before you build."** The Agent explores the UI, highlights elements via MCP, and populates the [`selector_vault.md`](.ai/3_MEMORY/selector_vault.md). No code is written yet—only verification.

### 🔵 **Phase 3: Architect Mode (Implementation)**

**"Strict Construction."** The Agent generates Page Objects and Tests, but it is **only** allowed to use selectors present in the Vault. This prevents "hallucinated" locators.

### 🔴 **Phase 4: Healer Mode (Maintenance & Fixes)**

**"Root Cause Analysis."** If a test fails, the Agent consults [`failure_patterns.md`](.ai/3_MEMORY/failure_patterns.md) to see if this is a known issue before attempting a hot-fix.

### 💾 **Phase 5: Git Commit Flow (Universal)**

**"Hygiene & Standards."** The Agent follows a strict Conventional Commits standard (`feat`, `map`, `heal`), ensuring the git history tells a story.

### 🌙 **Phase 6: Night Watchman Mode (Session Shutdown)**

**"Rollover."** The Agent summarizes the session, updates the logs, and cleans the active sprint file to save context tokens for the next run.

### 🔄 **Phase 7: Continuous Modes (As Needed)**

**"On Demand."** Specialized modes like **Smoke Test Mode** (Quick Health Check) and **Archaeology Mode** (Legacy Code Analysis) that can be triggered simply by asking.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- An MCP-compatible IDE (Cursor, Windsurf) or Agent Client.

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the protocol
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/smart-playwright-agent-protocol.git

# 2. Install dependencies (Includes MCP Server)
npm install

# 3. Start the MCP Server (if running standalone)
npm run mcp:start
```

### Usage (The Protocol)

**Do not just ask the AI to "write a test."** Initialize the protocol:

1. **Start a Session:**

> "Activate **Morning Ritual Mode**. Perform environment health check."

2. **Map a Feature:**

> "Activate **Cartographer Mode**. Map the 'Checkout' page. Verify selectors for the 'Place Order' button using MCP highlight."

3. **Build the Test:**

> "Activate **Architect Mode**. Create a Page Object for Checkout using the selectors from the Vault."

## 🛡️ "Self-Healing" vs. "Self-Correction"

While other agents try to "guess" fixes, this protocol uses **Institutional Memory**:

1. **Check:** Is the selector in [`selector_vault.md`](.ai/3_MEMORY/selector_vault.md)?
2. **Verify:** Use MCP to see if the element is still visible.
3. **Reference:** Check [`decision_log.md`](.ai/1_CONTEXT/decision_log.md) for architectural rules.
4. **Fix:** Update code + Update Vault + Log Failure Pattern.
